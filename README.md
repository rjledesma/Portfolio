## 📱 Responsiveness

- On **larger screens**, the layout uses a multi-column grid for better readability.  
- On **small screens**, the layout stacks into a **single column** for mobile-friendliness.  
- The **About section** adapts by stacking the profile picture below the text on smaller devices.
